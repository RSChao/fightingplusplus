# Fighting++

The Fighting++ plugin is a Minecraft plugin meant to enhance PvP experience by adding unique abilities based on the Devil Fruits from the One Piece anime!
These fruits contain custom techniques, including very powerful ultimate techniques, and only one player can equip each fruit, meaning that if player1 has the Hie Hie no Mi fruit, player2 can't eat it or it'll go to waste. But, since fruits can be removed through death, player2 can "steal" player1's fruit. Also, these fruits can be found in shipwreck treasures with a very low chance. Lastly, watch out for swimming after eating a fruit, as submerging your full body will cause you to start withering away untill you get back to safety and out of the water!

This plugin uses TechApi, a straight-forward way to manage techniques. Download it here:
